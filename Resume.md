# Resume

Hi there, my name is Pietro and I currently work at the BBC as the technical lead/principal web developer for their responsive news frameworks team. Our goal is to move BBC News (and related products) from their current stack to a cloud based infrastructure. I'm also a published author: [Pro Vim](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-Vim-Mark-McDonnell/dp/1484202511/ref=sr_1_1)

## BBC

I joined the BBC as a client-side specialist, before moving over to work primarily on the server-side. This has given me an understanding, appreciation and knowledge of the "full stack" workflow. My job at the BBC generally involves the following (agile) processes and toolsâ€¦

### tooling

- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)
- Continuous Integration
	- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
	- [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) and [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
	- I wrote a book on the topic called [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517) (published by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/))
- [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Tmate](http://tmate.io/) (for remote pair programming)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) Version Control System
	- Workflow involves: 
		- Ruthlessly small PRs
		- Rebase/Squash all commits into single commit (use GitHub's `Closes #123` and `Fixes #456` feature)
		- Cherry pick commit into `master` (GitHub will close the PR and any associated Issues automatically)
- [Trello](http://www.trello.com/) for Kanban tasks and workflow
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for project collaboration

### back-end

- [JRuby](http://jruby.org/)
	- Cloud based applications using the BBC's "Cosmos" service
	- AWS ([CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/))
	- Basic Linux administration (shell scripting)
- [PHP](http://php.net/)
	- Web Application built with [Zend Framework 1](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/reference.html)
- TDD (using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/))
- BDD (using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) and [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara))

### front-end

- Building interfaces and components that are:
	- [Mobile first](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first)
	- [Responsive](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) 
	- Performant ([networking](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028048.do) and [behaviour](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802806.do))
	- [Reusable](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
		- Specifically using [BEM](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/bem.html)
		- We also use the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS pre-processor
		- Semantic and well structured HTML
	- Simple
		- i.e. code isn't complected
		- e.g. have a [baseline](https://github.com/Integralist/CSS-Baseline), no "kitchen sink" approaches
- Constructing behaviours with:
	- Modular JavaScript
		- [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md)
		- [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)
	- Patterns: 
		- Mediator (for complex modules that require a mediator to handle interactions)
		- PubSub (for simpler modules to help them stay decoupled)

## Career highlights

### 2015

- Co-authored and designed event archive and automation service utilising AWS Lambda (which at the time supported only NodeJS)
- Worked (both as a developer and technical lead) on BBC service for the May 7th General Election event
- Developed a [Clojure version](https://github.com/Integralist/spurious-clojure-aws-sdk-helper) of the open-source [Spurious Ruby AWS SDK Helper](https://github.com/spurious-io/ruby-awssdk-helper) library, which helps developers to develop locally against a subset of AWS resources
	- Along with a very basic [example Clojure application](https://github.com/Integralist/spurious-clojure-example)
- Supported my team's development of a re-usable monitoring and logging solution
- Co-developed new AWS/Cloud based foundation for BBC Newsbeat
	- Built utilising our open-sourced [BBC Alephant framework](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant)

### 2014

- Working within a team that challenges itself to investigate and re-evaluate its stance on specific Ruby techniques and principles:
	- AOP, DI Containers, "JRuby native threads vs MRI GIL concurrency"
- Building (soon to be open-source) "Jello" application (integrating Trello with JIRA)
	- BBC utilises JIRA, but my team is more productive using Trello
	- We're required to provide visibility to other managers via JIRA
	- Hence we utilise the Trello API and JIRA REST API to provide synchronisation between the two
- Won two awards at the BBC Web Dev Gathering:
	- Best Public Relations of the Year (for my books [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517) and [tmux Taster](http://www.apress.com/9781484207765))
	- Most innovative use of Technology (this was a team award for our use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) within our CI environment and Sandbox testing platform, and anywhere else we could find a fit for it)
- Co-designed and built the architecture for BBC Newsbeat
	- This architecture was a preface to the next important piece of work, which is to move the BBC Responsive News website from it's "old stack" to an AWS based cloud infrastructure
- Developed the new [Alephant framework information portal repository](https://github.com/BBC-News/alephant)
	- This included building the individual example applications (Sender/Renderer/Broker)
	- Utilising [Spurious](https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious) and [Spurious Browser](https://github.com/stevenjack/spurious-browser) to allow working with AWS resources locally
	- Writing top-level documentation for both the framework and example applications
- Given the opportunity to take on the acting Tech Lead role for the BBC News Frameworks team
- Our team managed to reach a level of Continuous Delivery that was previously not possible
	- This included (amongst other tests and monitoring checks) JSON Schema validation for external APIs
- Was tech lead for the Market Data project (which utilised our Alephant framework)
- Getting to work on solving problems around concurrency and distributed systems
- Enabled more teams to utilise the BBC's custom CLI based Cosmos tool
	- The tool was originally designed around the [CFNDSL](https://github.com/Integralist/cfndsl) Ruby DSL. 
	- The main purpose of the tool was to avoid having to write large JSON CloudFormation documents
	- It also allowed developers to automate the updating of CloudFormation and EC2 config (otherwise developers would have to manually copy and paste CloudFormation into a BBC specific GUI)
	- The issue with the tool was that some teams weren't keen on CFNDSL and so they kept to writing JSON (some used YAML and then converted it into JSON). This meant these teams were unable to take advantage of the tool (as it required CFNDSL)
	- I resolved the issue by updating the CLI tool to allow users to provide data as YAML or JSON thus avoiding the need for CFNDSL and enabling more BBC teams to automate their workflow
- Co-designed and built a CI workflow around static asset compilation
	- [Sequence Diagram](http://cl.ly/image/3W2n4526411n)
	- Used lots of shell scripting to connect each of the nodes together
- Co-designed and built a cloud based distributed load test tool
	- Uses [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/)
	- Utilises AWS [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [AutoScaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) and [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
	- Infrastructure constructed using AWS [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- Arranged [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/) "Object-Oriented Design" presentation
	- Was the first public developer gathering *within* the [BBC Broadcasting House](http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/)
	- Sandi gave me an honoured mention in the opening of her talk which discussed her own personal journey hoping to one day give a presentation to the BBC (something her parents were happy to finally hear was happening)
- Took initiative to document the BBC Cosmos service
	- The original documentation was very terse and not useful to consumers
	- Any new understanding I accumulated whilst using the service was documented in a GitHub wiki
	- Ensured developers were kept up to date on any changes I was making (asking for feedback and input)
	- The hope was to garner interest in its use (helping us to move off the "old" stack and into cloud development)
- Worked on JRuby based back-end architecture for 2014 elections and Scottish Referendum
	- Utilised AWS ([SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/))

	- Code is [open-source](https://github.com/Integralist/Sass-Base64-Extension)
	- Works around IE8 "> 32kb" bug
- Refactored large chunks of code 
	- e.g. ~600 loc Sass mixin to a working 7 loc
- Introduced GruntJS to help different teams automate their processes
	- I open-sourced my findings into a project called [Grunt Boilerplate](https://github.com/Integralist/Grunt-Boilerplate)
- Co-developed the BBC News touch interaction photo gallery feature

- [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
  	- I've started developing more with Clojure (I'm currently working on a an image processing application in my spare time called "Koinonia") as I find the language (and LISP in general) quite a pleasure to work with. My intention is to continue to increase my knowledge so I can push this into being a primarily language.

	- I like the CSP (channel based) concurrency model they're using
	- The stripped back syntax, fast compiler, almost C-like speed and compositional code sharing are all nice features
- [Functional Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (immutable state, referential transparency, currying and partial application etc)
	- I wrote a blog post about [understanding recursion in functional JavaScript programming](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/js-recursion.html)
	- Enjoy considering the differences between [OOP and FP](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/a96cf6d6f01d5d0cce0a)

	- I've created a [repository](https://github.com/Integralist/Linux-and-Docker-Development-Environment) 
		- Utilises Ruby within a Docker container
		- I provision the Ubuntu instance with specific developer essentials
		- Part of the the provisioning is ensuring Docker client can be accessed outside the VM
- [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
	- Although I've [built](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/appcache.html) some [tools](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/squirrel.html) using Node, I'm not necessarily a big fan
	- Would consider using only if it was the appropriate approach for the problem

### Past experiences

> This would be stuff I've used in the past and could probably pick up again if necessary

- JS libraries such as Ender & jQuery, along with the [MVC extension Backbone](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/backbone.html)
- ActionScript 3.0
- Classic ASP and an early ASP.NET

### Miscellaneous

> Stuff that just didn't fit anywhere else
 
- Developed my own [style guides](https://github.com/Integralist/Style-Guides) (although admittedly they could do with an update)

## Previously

Prior to the BBC I worked for a creative agency called [Storm Creative](http://stormcreative.co.uk) from February 2001 - December 2012.

At Storm I was a technical lead under the role of 'Digital Media Manager' which included the following responsibilitiesâ€¦ 

- Programming
	- front-end development
	- prototyping using latest tools and technologies
- Managing 'Digital Media' Department
	- Delegating work to staff (programmers)
	- Ensuring work is done on time
	- Handling staff questions/issues
	- Managing clients
	- Invoicing
	- Server management (Apache)
- Project Manager
	- Meeting with clients and understanding requirements
	- Booking in work with different departments (creative, copy writing)
	- Creating schematics/architecture of applications
	
Storm had carried out a lot of work for the NHS, Art Council, local government as well as local businesses and a two year long project called [LickList](http://www.licklist.co.uk). 

In 2012 Storm started work on a financial business venture called [Money Republic](https://moneyrepublic.com) which I was involved with the stage one build and over saw the project's technical architecture (pushing for the mobile first development process and responsive web design aspects), but it was my team who were responsible for the programming of most of the site with the exception of the home page's core feature which was a loan application widget which was heavily JavaScript based (along with other JavaScript heavy widgets throughout the site). 

Note: since leaving Storm the code base for Money Republic has changed significantly I'm afraid so much of what I had developed is no longer in use.

While managing the Digital Media Department I looked after a team of developers (two back-end and two front-end). After two years one of our front-end devs took the skills I had passed onto him and acquired a role at the London/American agency [Mint](http://mintdigital.com).

## Summary

I ideally want to get across two fundamental things about me:

1. I'm very passionate about programming and the openness of the web.
2. I love getting the chance to learn and experience new things.
