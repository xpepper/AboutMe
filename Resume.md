# Resume

Hi there, my name is Pietro and I currently work at XPeppers as agile coach and XP software engineer. 
* I like to coach teams and help them improve and be better at their job.
* I'm a passionate coder, working mostly with Java and Ruby.

I enjoy talking about agile methods, lean software development and more broadly about every principle, practice or process that improve the way we work day by day.

Iâ€™m always looking for better ways of doing things.
