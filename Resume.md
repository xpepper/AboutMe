# Resume

Hi there, my name is Pietro and I currently work at XPeppers as agile coach and XP software engineer.

I like to coach teams and help them improve and be better at their job. 

But I cannot live without putting my hands on a keyboard: I'm a passionate coder, working mostly with Java and Ruby. I like to design, code, test-drive, build and run systems to solve people's needs. 

I enjoy talking about agile methods, lean software development and more broadly about every principle, practice or process that may improve the way we work day by day.
Iâ€™m always looking for better ways of doing things.

## XPeppers

I joined XPeppers as an Agile Coach and XP Software Engineer.

I coach our own dev team and mentor other dev teams on adopting agile methods. Together with Lorenzo Cassulo I started this brand new office in Trento, and gradually built a fantastic team. I led several projects (in the "projects" section you'll fine more details about some of them).

## Summary

I ideally want to get across two fundamental things about me:

1. I like to coach teams and help them improve and be better at their job.
2. I'm very passionate about programming and learning.
