# Resume

I am a **passionate coder**, I like to build products that can change the life of the people.  
I am a **coach and a trainer**, I feel proud when I can help my team peers to become greater every day at their job.  
I am an **agile developer**, I try to embody the agile and lean principles in my professional life.  

## What I do
I currently work for **XPeppers**, where I help clients to shape their ideas into actual digital products, using **agile methods**, and more generally any approach that can help the success of the project.

Here at XPeppers I put as much effort in developing products as I put in helping my peers to growth, pairing with them as much as I can, helping them to progress in their studies, making code katas with them, and learn the essence of the agile methods. Agile methods basically boil down to inspect & adapt, work in tiny steps, use short feedback loops, learn constantly and visualize everything. And work together.

Technically speaking I have used mainly **Java** and **Ruby** as programming languages. I use **Javascript** too, mainly on the server side (NodeJS). But, more than languages, I try to learn techniques that help me work better and with lower stress in any context I may happen to work into: **TDD**, **Refactoring**, **Continuous Integration**, **Project Automation** and **Visualization**.
