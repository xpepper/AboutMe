# About me
I am a **passionate coder**, I like to build products that can change the life of people.   
I am a **coach and a trainer**, I feel proud when I can help my teammates to become greater every day at their job.   
I am an **agile developer**, I try to embody the agile and lean principles in my professional life.   

## What I do
I currently work for [XPeppers](https://www.xpeppers.com/) (a [Claranet](https://www.claranet.it/) company), where I help clients to shape their ideas into actual digital products, using **agile methods**, and more generally any approach that can help a project to succeed.

Here at XPeppers I put as much effort in developing products as I put in helping my teammates grow, **pair-programming** with them as much as I can, helping them to progress in their own studies, making code katas with them, and sharing the essence of agile methods.

Yes, **I love agile methods!**
I started with **eXtreme Programming** (XP) in 2002, in the first XP team in Italy.    
Then I widened out my experiences with **Scrum**, **Lean** and **Kanban**, which all have great and inspiring principles.   
In the end, "being agile" basically boils down to inspect & adapt, work in tiny steps, use short feedback loops, learn constantly and visualize everything. And work together.

Technically speaking in my career I've used **Java** and **Ruby** extensively. I used **Javascript** too, mainly on the server side (NodeJS).    
Recently I fell in love with **Kotlin**, which is the language I'm most proficient in, together with **Java**.

But, besides programming languages, I try to learn and use techniques which help me work better, reducing the risks and lowering the stress, in any context I may happen to work: **Test-Driven Development**, **Refactoring**, **Continuous Integration**, **Project Automation** (and **DevOps** practices, too) among others.

I'm also a firmly believer in the power of **Visualization**, from visualizing the value stream of a production process, and capturing the workflow of a team on a board, to sketching ideas and diagrams.    
All those activities, in my experience, helps you and your team building a shared understanding, creating alignment between people and grasping new and unrealized insights and improvement opportunities.

I consider myself a *full-stack developer*, meaning that I deeply care for the overall outcome of the project efforts, end-to-end, not just that my (or my team's) tasks are in the DONE column in a task board somewhere.

I'm also a **conference speaker**, because I love sharing what I've learned and receive feedback from others about my ideas. And because, after all, I like challenges.    
My most recent presentations were about [the daily journal practice we use in our teams](http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/vivere-per-raccontarla-limportanza-del-daily-journal-in-un-team-agile), [improving your hiring process to create a great team](http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/hiring-great-people-how-we-improved-our-recruiting-process-to-build-and-grow-a-great-agile-team), [creating a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda](https://slides.com/pierodibello/lessons-learned-from-aws-lambda) and some [lessons I learned on continuous delivery on a Java project](http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/continuous-delivery-su-progetti-java-cosa-abbiamo-imparato-facendoci-del-male). It was an honor and a pleasure for me to speak about these topics at Codemotion Berlin, ScanAgile Helsinki, Codemotion Milan, Italian Agile Days, among others.

### Noteworthy experiences I recently had

##### [Mercury Payment Services](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Payment_Services) (then NEXI) - Payment service provider *(May 2016 - May 2021)*

I lead the team working on several products composing the main payment solution for the largest italian bank.
My team worked on:
* the payment gateway and its components
* the ACSs (one compliant to protocol 3DS 1.0, the other following the new 3DS 2.0 standard)

##### [Paros](https://www.paros.srl) - Payment platform for public administrations *(July 2014 - April 2016)*

As an agile coach, I trained the dev team of the client on the engineering practices of XP, starting from clean code, TDD, refactoring and continuous integration.
Then I worked everyday as an embedded component of the dev team (together with other colleagues from XPeppers), helping them embracing an agile and lean process (mainly Scrum plus technical practices from XP).
The platform is basically a backend developed in Java, publishing an API consumed by a single-page app (AngularJS). We've also developed a backoffice webapp, developed using the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) with Java.

The developed architecture uses extensively the [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern and an [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) approach, to track all changes of the core application state as a sequence of events.

##### **[PhotoVogue](http://www.vogue.it/photovogue)** - Social network for fashion photographers *(April 2016 - June 2016)*

As an agile developer, I helped building the backend API for this platform, a social network for fashion photographers, with 150.000 users, 400.000 photos and 3.000 new photos uploaded daily. We used [a serverless architecture on AWS Lambda](http://slides.com/pierodibello/lessons-learned-from-aws-lambda#/).

##### **[Famas System](http://www.famassystem.it/)** - Intelligent Transportation Systems *(from March 2016)*
As an agile coach I'm supporting Famas in evaluating an agile process for the development of their products.

##### **[BeMyEye](https://it.bemyeye.com/)** - Mobile crowdsourcing *(May 2016)*

As a trainer, I've held a course on the Java language for a team that had to switch their technological stack from PHP to Java and AngularJS. The resources I used (exercises, examples, stuff to read and study) are published on github:
