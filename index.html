<a id="résumé" class="anchor" href="#r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Résumé</h1>

<p>I am a <strong>passionate coder</strong>, I like to build products that can change the life of the people.<br>
I am a <strong>coach and a trainer</strong>, I feel proud when I can help my team peers to become greater every day at their job.<br>
I am an <strong>agile developer</strong>, I try to embody the agile and lean principles in my professional life.  </p>

<a id="what-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I do</h2>

<p>I currently work for <strong>XPeppers</strong>, where I help clients to shape their ideas into actual digital products, using <strong>agile methods</strong>, and more generally any approach that can help the success of the project.</p>

<p>Here at XPeppers I put as much effort in developing products as I put in helping my peers to grow, pairing with them as much as I can, helping them to progress in their studies, making code katas with them, and learning the essence of the agile methods. Agile methods basically boil down to inspect &amp; adapt, work in tiny steps, use short feedback loops, learn constantly and visualize everything. And work together.</p>

<p>Technically speaking I have used mainly <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong> as programming languages. I use <strong>Javascript</strong> too, mainly on the server side (NodeJS). But, more than languages, I try to learn techniques that help me work better and with lower stress in any context I may happen to work into: <strong>TDD</strong>, <strong>Refactoring</strong>, <strong>Continuous Integration</strong>, <strong>Project Automation</strong> and <strong>Visualization</strong>.</p>

<p>I like to write short posts on <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/xpepper">Gist</a></strong>. I'm using Gist as a sort of microblogging framework, I'm also <strong><a href="https://github.com/xpepper/Roughdraft">help around an app</a></strong> with this purpose.</p>

<p>A legacy blog is <a href="http://xplayer.github.io">here</a>, but it's really old.</p>
