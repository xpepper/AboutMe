And work together.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking in my career I have used **Java** and **Ruby** extensively. I use **Javascript** too, mainly on the server side (NodeJS).  \r\nBut, besides programming languages, I try to learn and use techniques which help me work better, reducing the risks and lowering the stress, in any context I may happen to work: **Test-Driven Development**, **Refactoring**, **Continuous Integration**, **Project Automation** (and **DevOps** practices, too) among others.\r\n\r\nI'm also a firmly believer in the power of **Visualization**, from visualizing the value stream of a production process, and capturing the workflow of a team on a board, to sketching ideas and diagrams. All those activities, in my experience, helps you and your team building a shared understanding, creating alignment between people and grasping new and unrealized insights and improvement opportunities.\r\n\r\nI consider myself a *full-stack developer*, meaning that I deeply care for the overall outcome of the project efforts, not just that my (or my team's) tasks are in the DONE column in a task board somewhere.\r\n\r\nI'm also a **conference speaker**, because I love sharing what I've learned and receive feedback from others about my ideas. And because, after all, I like challenges.  \r\nMy most recent presentations were about [improving your hiring process to create a great team](http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/hiring-great-people-how-we-improved-our-recruiting-process-to-build-and-grow-a-great-agile-team)<sup>[1](#hiringvideo)</sup>, [creating a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda](https://slides.com/pierodibello/lessons-learned-from-aws-lambda) and some [lessons I learned on continuous delivery on a Java project](http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/continuous-delivery-su-progetti-java-cosa-abbiamo-imparato-facendoci-del-male). It was an honor and a pleasure for me to speak about these topics at Codemotion Berlin, ScanAgile Helsinki, Codemotion Milan, Italian Agile Days Brescia, among others.\r\n\r\n### Noteworthy experiences I recently had\r\n\r\n##### [Paros](https://www.paros.srl) - Payment platform for public administrations *(July 2014 - April 2016)*\r\n\r\nAs an agile coach, I trained the dev team of the client on the engineering practices of XP, starting from clean code, TDD, refactoring and continuous integration.   \r\nThen I worked everyday as an embedded component of the dev team (together with other colleagues from XPeppers), helping them embracing an agile and lean process (mainly Scrum plus technical practices from XP).\r\nThe platform is basically a backend developed in Java, publishing an API consumed by a single-page app (AngularJS). We've also developed a backoffice webapp, developed using the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) with Java.\r\n\r\nThe developed architecture uses extensively the [CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern and an [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) approach, to track all changes of the core application state as a sequence of events.\r\n\r\n##### **[PhotoVogue](http://www.vogue.it/photovogue)** - Social network for fashion photographers *(April 2016 - June 2016)*\r\n\r\nAs an agile developer, I helped building the backend API for this platform, a social network for fashion photographers, with 150.000 users, 400.000 photos and 3.000 new photos uploaded daily. We used [a serverless architecture on AWS Lambda](http://slides.com/pierodibello/lessons-learned-from-aws-lambda#/).\r\n\r\n##### **[Famas System](http://www.famassystem.it/)** - Intelligent Transportation Systems *(from March 2016)*\r\nAs an agile coach I'm supporting Famas in evaluating an agile process for the development of their products.\r\n\r\n##### **[BeMyEye](https://it.bemyeye.com/)** - Mobile crowdsourcing *(May 2016)*\r\n\r\nAs a trainer, I've held a course on the Java language for a team that had to switch their technological stack from PHP to Java and AngularJS. The resources I used (exercises, examples, stuff to read and study) are published on github:\r\nhttps://github.com/xpepper/java-basics\r\n\r\n**For more detailed project descriptions please look them up on [LinkedIn](https://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello).**\r\n\r\n#### Some of the books I've recently read\r\n* Turn the Ship Around! A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders *by L. David Marquet* (currently reading...)\r\n* Kanban in Action *by Marcus Hammarberg and Joakim Sunden*\r\n* Lean Change Management: Innovative Practices For Managing Organizational Change *by Jason Little*\r\n* Node.js in Action *by Cantelon, Harter et. al.*\r\n* Hiring Geeks That Fit *by Johanna Rothman*\r\n\r\n## Where to find more about me\r\n### LinkedIn: https://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello\r\nYou can find more info about me on **[my LinkedIn page](https://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello)**. There you'll find some of my most relevant experiences, some projects I worked on, several presentations I gave about topics I care. And you can also find some nice photos taken here and there.\r\n\r\n### GitHub: https://github.com/xpepper\r\nOn **[GitHub](https://github.com/xpepper)** you can find my personal projects, some projects I follow, and several exercises and katas I keep repeating.\r\n\r\n### Presentations\r\nYou can find some of my slides here:\r\n\r\n* http://www.slideshare.net/pierodibello/\r\n* https://speakerdeck.com/pierodibello\r\n* https://slides.com/pierodibello\r\n\r\n### Blogging: https://gist.github.com/xpepper\r\nI like to write short posts on **[Gist](https://gist.github.com/xpepper)**. I'm using Gist as a sort of microblogging framework, I'm also **[help around an app](https://github.com/xpepper/Roughdraft)** with this purpose.\r\n\r\nA legacy blog is [here](http://xplayer.github.io), but it's really old.\r\n\r\n### Other places\r\nSometimes **[I tweet](https://twitter.com/pierodibello)**, but not that frequently. Sometimes I take nice pictures and publish them on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pierodibello/)**.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n<a name=\"myfootnote1\">1</a>: [This is a video recording](https://vimeo.com/147029155) of the session taken at Agile Days 2015 (in italian).\r\n",
