  "body": "# Résumé\r\n\r\nI am a **passionate coder**, I like to build products that can change the life of the people.  \r\nI am a **coach and a trainer**, I feel proud when I can help my team peers to become greater every day at their job.  \r\nI am an **agile developer**, I try to embody the agile and lean principles in my professional life.  \r\n\r\n## What I do\r\nI currently work for **XPeppers**, where I help clients to shape their ideas into actual digital products, using **agile methods**, and more generally any approach that can help the success of the project.\r\n\r\nHere at XPeppers I put as much effort in developing products as I put in helping my peers to grow, pairing with them as much as I can, helping them to progress in their studies, making code katas with them, and learning the essence of the agile methods. Agile methods basically boil down to inspect & adapt, work in tiny steps, use short feedback loops, learn constantly and visualize everything. And work together.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking I have used mainly **Java** and **Ruby** as programming languages. I use **Javascript** too, mainly on the server side (NodeJS). But, more than languages, I try to learn techniques that help me work better and with lower stress in any context I may happen to work into: **TDD**, **Refactoring**, **Continuous Integration**, **Project Automation** and **Visualization**.\r\n\r\n## Where to find more about me\r\n### LinkedIn: https://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello\r\nYou can find more info about me on **[my LinkedIn page](https://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello)**. There you'll find some of my most relevant experiences, some projects I worked on, several presentations I gave about topics I care. And you can also find some nice photos taken here and there.\r\n\r\n### GitHub: https://github.com/xpepper\r\nOn **[GitHub](https://github.com/xpepper)** you can find my personal projects, some projects I follow, and several exercises and katas I keep repeating.\r\n\r\n### Blogging: https://gist.github.com/xpepper\r\nI like to write short posts on **[Gist](https://gist.github.com/xpepper)**. I'm using Gist as a sort of microblogging framework, I'm also **[help around an app](https://github.com/xpepper/Roughdraft)** with this purpose.\r\n\r\nA legacy blog is [here](http://xplayer.github.io), but it's really old.\r\n\r\n### Other places\r\nSometimes **[I tweet](https://twitter.com/pierodibello)**, but not that frequently. Sometimes I take nice pictures and publish them on **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pierodibello/)**.\r\n",
