{"name":"Pietro Di Bello","tagline":"Agile and XP Coach at XPeppers","body":"# Resume\r\n\r\nHi there, my name is Pietro and I currently work at XPeppers as agile coach and XP software engineer.\r\n\r\nI like to coach teams and help them improve and be better at their job. \r\n\r\nBut I cannot live without putting my hands on a keyboard: I'm a passionate coder, working mostly with Java and Ruby. I like to design, code, test-drive, build and run systems to solve people's needs. \r\n\r\nI enjoy talking about agile methods, lean software development and more broadly about every principle, practice or process that may improve the way we work day by day.\r\nIâ€™m always looking for better ways of doing things.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can find me online at the following locations:\r\n\r\n- [My resume](http://it.linkedin.com/in/pietrodibello) on Linkedin\r\n- [My blog](http://xplayer.github.io/) (not writing frequently as I would though)\r\n- [My notes and thoughts](http://xpepper.roughdraft.io/)\r\n- Fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/xpepper)!\r\n- [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/pierodibello)\r\n- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/pierodibello/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [XPeppers](#xpeppers)\r\n- [Career highlights](#career-highlights)\r\n- [Skills](#skills)\r\n- [Published](#published)\r\n- [Open Source Projects](#open-source-projects)\r\n- [Previously](#previously)\r\n- [Summary](#summary)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## XPeppers\r\n\r\nI joined XPeppers as an Agile Coach and XP Software Engineer.\r\n\r\nI coach our own dev team and mentor other dev teams on adopting agile methods. Together with Lorenzo Cassulo I started this brand new office in Trento, and gradually built a fantastic team. I led several projects (in the \"projects\" section you'll fine more details about some of them).\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI ideally want to get across two fundamental things about me:\r\n\r\n1. I like to coach teams and help them improve and be better at their job.\r\n2. I'm very passionate about programming and learning.","google":"UA-38377452-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
